# HOG-SVM-to-identity-the-head-python-
python+opencv used HOG+SVM to identify the head in the bus, including night and day
An experimental job assigned by my professor.
The task is detect the head in the bus, no matter what method, DL is OK, but this lesson is about image processing, so i decided using the traditional algorithm HOG+SVM.
